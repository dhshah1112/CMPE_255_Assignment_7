# CMPE_255_Assignment_7

Part A : The assignment was to write a colab for dimensionality reduction techniques. I employed various Dimentionality Reduction techniques.  The colab included PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE as well as UMAP and t-sne. I chose the digits dataset. Then I proceeded to do proper visualization as well as techniques showcasing selecting the hyperparameter and how it affected the data. Further details can be found in the link attached below :

Part B : The assignment was assignment to write a colab to illustrate how dimensionality reduction technique like umap can be used followed by clustering. Then I also implemented how classification feature extraction techniques. There are various visualizations as well in the colab notebook. Further details can be found in the link attached below :

Part C : In this part of assignment I demonstrated dimensionality reduction using data bricks notebook. I used various visualizations to demnostrate as well. Then I proceeded to Post Dimentionality Reduction steps which included Clustering, Co-relation, Feature Importance.  Further details can be found in the link attached below :
